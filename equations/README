Like some of my other projects, my current version doesn't completely work anymore because of the last modifications.
But you can find some old version somewhere that somehow works.

isolate.pl was he first big part of the project

the main script is equations.pl

I started refactoring the code in OOP in the folder equations/module/equations_module_NEW/.

But the real projects is in equations/module/
and the main script is still equations.pl
------------------------------------------------

the photos isolate.pl.png equations.pl.png
shows what the scripts do.

It was originally a before/after picture showing the latest feature at the time which was
transforming the AST form (or maybe the postfix form) of the equation in infix
in such a way that only required parenthesess from the operator precedence perspective were shown.
